# Pokemon Viewing Portal Challenge

Welcome to the Pokemon Viewing Portal challenge! This technical interview challenge is designed to assess your skills in web development and API integration. The goal is to create a web application that allows users to view information about different Pokemon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Challenge Overview

### Task

Create a Pokemon Viewing Portal that fetches and displays information about Pokemon from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Requirements

1. **Homepage:** Create a homepage that lists some Pokemon. You can choose a specific generation or showcase a mix of Pokemon.

2. **Pokemon Details:** When a user clicks on a Pokemon from the list, they should be taken to a page displaying detailed information about that Pokemon. This information should include:
    - Name
    - Image
    - Types (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass)
    - Abilities
    - Base experience

3. **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature that allows users to search for a specific Pokemon by name.

4. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different devices.
